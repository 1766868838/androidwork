(CNN)President Donald Trump on Tuesday fired the Department of Homeland Security official who had rejected Trump's claims of widespread voter fraud.

Trump announced on Twitter he was firing Chris Krebs, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and directly tied it to Krebs' statement that said there "is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised."
"The recent statement by Chris Krebs on the security of the 2020 Election was highly inaccurate, in that there were massive improprieties and fraud," Trump said in a tweet before repeating multiple baseless conspriacy theories about the election. "Therefore, effective immediately, Chris Krebs has been terminated as Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency."
CNN reported that Krebs, who ran the cyber arm of the Department of Homeland Security, expected to be fired.
In the lead-up to the election, Krebs had often quietly disputed the President's repeated false claims about mail-in ballots but went out of his way to not get drawn into criticizing his boss for spreading lies.
But in the days that have followed, Krebs has adopted a more forceful approach regularly posting on Twitter -- often with blaring red siren emojis -- fact checks of the claims and conspiracy theories being pushed by Trump, his allies and supporters around the country.
Krebs has been responsible for a widely praised revamp of the department's cybersecurity efforts and increasing coordination with state and local governments, as the first director of CISA. He served as one of the most key federal national security officials that oversaw an election that by all accounts went very smoothly.
Foreign adversaries were not able to affect any of the votes, CISA said, and it was "the most secure election in American history," according to them and the wider group of public and private election officials. That was the statement for which the President decided to fire Krebs on Tuesday evening.
Krebs kept up the fact check of the President's conspiracy-mongering until the final hours of his tenure, tweeting earlier Tuesday that claims of manipulation of election systems "either have been unsubstantiated or are technically incoherent." He was quoting from a letter signed by 59 election specialists that also said that "anyone asserting that a US election was 'rigged' is making an extraordinary claim" and called them "alarming assertions."
Firing Krebs, a US official previously told CNN, would "cross a red line" and set off alarm bells throughout the national security apparatus.
Still, his dismissal comes after several of the Pentagon's most senior civilian officials were replaced with officials perceived as loyal to the President, and reports of Trump's increasing frustration with CIA Director Gina Haspel.

Three terrible presidential transitions that hurt America
Opinion by Thomas Balcerski

Updated 1619 GMT (0019 HKT) November 17, 2020

(CNN)More than two weeks after Election Day, President Donald Trump still refuses to concede the race to former Vice President Joe Biden. Some high-ranking former officials from Trump's own administration (most recently his former chief of staff, John Kelly) have called for a smooth transition. And yet, many Republicans in Congress continue to stand by the President.

In reality, Trump is a lame duck president. Trump's presidency has been unprecedented in many ways, but in this regard, he is like all his predecessors: His term in office will come to an end, and he will have to depart the White House to begin his next chapter. How Trump chooses to conduct the remaining days of his administration may yet define his presidency and prove a critical moment in American history.
Unfortunately, the country has suffered through some truly terrible transitions. Three such transfers of power come to mind â€” James Buchanan to Abraham Lincoln during the secession winter of 1860 to 1861; Herbert Hoover to Franklin Delano Roosevelt during the worsening economic crisis of 1932 to 1933; and Bill Clinton to George W. Bush after the bitterly contested election of 2000.
As January 20, 2021, approaches, the need for an effective transition has never been greater. The worsening Covid-19 pandemic demands a strong response from the executive branch, which will require the outgoing president to cooperate with the president-elect for the good of the nation. To avoid further tragedy, Trump and Biden must avoid the mistakes of these truly poor transitions.
Here are three critical lame-duck periods from the nation's past.

1860-1861: James Buchanan to Abraham Lincoln

Abraham Lincoln's inauguration as 16th President of the United States at Washington, D.C., with outgoing President James Buchanan and Chief Justice of the United States Roger Brooke Taney.
The election of 1860 provoked a serious challenge to presidential transition. In November, Lincoln won sufficient votes in the Electoral College to beat three challengers and secure a term as president. One month later, South Carolina gathered a statewide convention and unanimously voted to secede from the Union. Soon thereafter, six more southern states followed suit.
Lame duck President Buchanan poorly managed the developing crisis. He announced himself against southern secession, yet he also believed the government powerless to prevent the action. Instead, Buchanan looked to Congress for a solution. A gathering of "old gentlemen" in Washington, DC, yielded a series of appeasement measures, known as the Crittenden Compromise, which aimed to protect slavery by constitutional provision.
But President-elect Lincoln wisely refused to accept any compromise emanating from the unpopular Buchanan administration. On Inauguration Day, Lincoln called on Buchanan at the White House, and the two men rode together in an open carriage to the Capitol. Despite a conciliatory inaugural address, war erupted when Confederate forces fired on Fort Sumter in April 1861.
The new Republican Congress was furious with Buchanan's actions during the lame duck period. They took away the franking privilege for ex-presidents (thus requiring them to affix their own postage) -- and even declined to pay for Buchanan's official portrait.
Buchanan defended his actions on the "eve of rebellion" in what historians consider the first presidential memoir, but he failed to rehabilitate his reputation. For his inaction as the Union fell apart around him, he is routinely ranked the worst president in American history.
1932-1933: Herbert Hoover to Franklin D. Roosevelt
By 1932, the Great Depression had plunged the American economy to new lows. Confidence had been lost in the banking system, farmers could find no market for their crops and unemployment reached nearly 25%.
In November, Roosevelt's promise of a government-sponsored New Deal handily defeated Hoover's campaign for cooperative voluntarism among private individuals. The day after Election Day, at 9:34 p.m., Hoover begrudgingly conceded by telegram, writing: "In the common purpose of all of us, I shall dedicate myself to every possible helpful effort."
On the day of Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#39;s presidential inauguration in 1933, he rides with his predecessor Herbert Hoover to the ceremony.

But, in reality, Hoover did everything in his power to stand in the way of Roosevelt's New Deal. In effect, Hoover wanted Roosevelt to renounce portions of the New Deal, like his public works programs, before taking office. In turn, Roosevelt refused to collaborate in any way with the outgoing president.
In the meantime, the effects of the Great Depression only worsened. On Inauguration Day, Hoover and Roosevelt shared a tense ride from the White House to the Capitol, with Roosevelt making small talk about the impressive preparations along the parade route.
Mercifully, the extended lame-duck period, designed for an era when Americans traveled by horse or sail, was nearing its end. In 1933, Congress belatedly passed legislation -- first proposed by Sen. George Norris of Nebraska in 1923 -- that eventually became the 20th Amendment to the US Constitution. Among other things, the "lame duck amendment" moved forward the expiration of an outgoing president's term from March 4 to January 20 at noon.
2000-2001: Bill Clinton to George W. Bush

Little did the country know the crisis that would unfold starting on November 7, 2000. In one of the closest races in American history, Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush each racked up key wins in the battleground states. Yet no winner could be declared in the crucial state of Florida, despite nearly every major network calling the state earlier in the night for Gore and then reversing the call in Bush's favor.
Believing that he had lost, Gore had actually telephoned Bush to concede. The vice president was en route to speak before an assembled crowd at the War Memorial in Nashville, when aides frantically rushed to stop him from going on stage. News that Florida was too close to call now convinced Gore to retract his concession and thus began a weekslong legal fight. Finally, after the Supreme Court stopped the Florida recount, Gore conceded on December 13 in a nationally televised address.
As the nation awaited the result, the General Services Administration, the agency tasked with smoothing the transition to the new president, withheld "ascertainment" from both candidates. The decision delayed implementation of the Presidential Transition Act, which provides for office space and equipment as well as funds to support the incoming administration. However, Bush did receive classified briefings (and Gore received them as vice president). Still, in 2004, the 9/11 Commission found that this slow transition "hampered" the new administration's ability to place key officials in national security roles.
Yet the drama was not over -- President Bill Clinton's administration did not go quietly into the night. Allegations surfaced that personnel ripped phones from the walls, defaced bathrooms, and, perhaps most childishly, removed the letter "W" from keyboards in White House computers (Clinton staffers denied many of the claims). The General Accounting Office issued a report estimating some $15,000 worth of damages.

In response, Bush diligently worked to ensure a professional transition, when the time came to pass power to President-elect Barack Obama. Described as the "gold standard" of presidential transition, Obama himself followed the model in the peaceful transfer of power to Trump.
Of course, Trump may yet concede the election and thus follow a venerable tradition of unifying the country that dates back to 1896. From there, he might follow past precedent and choose to attend his successor's inauguration.
Yet if past is prologue, the nation should expect a continued crisis and a challenging transition period ahead. As we have too many times before, we must be prepared for a long winter of division between the outgoing and incoming administrations -- and for the nation to suffer the consequences.

How Trump could get credit for a Covid-19 breakthrough
Opinion by Kent Sepkowitz

Updated 2325 GMT (0725 HKT) November 17, 2020

(CNN)For the second consecutive week, exciting Covid-19 vaccine data have hit the news. Last week, it was the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine candidate and this week, one from Moderna.
The two companies have developed a similar but not identical messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine and, combined, have announced early results involving more than 70,000 participants, half of whom received placebo. To date, the population given real vaccine have had less than one-tenth the number of Covid-19 infections than those receiving placebo.
This means that there is hope for an effective vaccine on the horizon. Just like President Donald Trump promised repeatedly.
Of course, the President's Warp Speed predictions usually were met with derisive dismissals by those "in the know" (including me) who saw a much longer, harder, more side-effect riddled and overall, less fairy tale-ish road ahead.
And even with the news this month, many experts continue to be appropriately cautious until the results are scrutinized and studied more closely and more time has passed for side effects to appear. After all, mRNA vaccines are different than traditional vaccines; while the vaccines we are used to administering use some form of a virus to elicit immunity in the human body, an mRNA vaccine uses mRNA (a biological molecule) to trick the body into manufacturing Covid-19 specific antibodies.
This latter process has the makings of the early chapters of a Michael Crichton sci-fi disaster-thriller. Make no mistake, though: this is a true milestone. Real vaccines have prevented real Covid-19 infections in real humans. And the benefit was seen in a startlingly high proportion of people.
We should be rejoicing, at least briefly. But rather, we already have sunk into a tribal Trumper versus not-Trumper debate; the President's backers claim he was central to the vaccine advance while others counter that this all happened in spite of, not because of, Trump.
This type of political nonsense is not surprising -- the same "debate" about a major national accomplishment dogged the daring capture and execution of Osama bin Laden in May 2011. Then, presidential candidates were jockeying for position and gave muted praise of the standing president an approach that, a year later, became open criticism over the Obama Administration's handling of their accomplishment. Perhaps the most jarring was soon-to-be Republican nominee Mitt Romney who dismissed the president's work by claiming, in a two-for-one insult, that "even Jimmy Carter would have given that order."
That was not the time, nor is this, to argue over who gets credit for what. Perhaps the President moved in this direction because it seemed easier than other Covid-19 control efforts or for votes or to goose pharmaceutical earnings or because he and his administration were moved by the calamity unfolding on their watch. His motive is irrelevant; the scientific advance is real.

And in that spirit, as one who remains extremely critical of President Trump's handling of the pandemic, may I say, thank you, Mr. President. You did a good thing by allowing money to flow to address a national crisis. Operation Warp Speed, a nearly $10 billion government program seeking to make 300 million doses of a vaccine -- the initial doses of which would be available by January next year -- shows early signs of success. As such, you have embraced a core progressive tenet that big government, featuring major federal dollars that in this case give scientists free rein to chase ideas, ultimately pays off.
That said, this accomplishment does not change the Trump team's flunking grade on their handling the pandemic. Rather it shows how badly it performed. Covid-19 was in many ways the easiest problem the President faced. Not the easiest to solve -- we are a long way from getting the pandemic under control -- but the steps to control it were all laid out long ago. Yet the Trump administration ignored (and continues to ignore) scientific evidence while hoping that, by ignoring it, the virus would, "like a miracle," disappear.
The science isn't confusing: masks and distancing and testing and avoiding indoor crowds. Despite coronavirus task force doctor Scott Atlas' infuriating doublespeak, the evidence isn't controversial. Sure, Covid-19 precaution is no fun, lacks the glamor of a scientific breakthrough and is, like most of public health, a bit boring. But the ABCs of outbreak control are much better grounded than a move to invest billions of dollars in scientific research -- and not just any science but science at the most wildly futuristic, the highest of the high tech, elbowing our human-made widgets into the mysterious realm of our spiraling DNA. Very 22nd century stuff.
Had the Trump administration handed over not just vaccine development but the rest of the pandemic to the scientists, tens of thousands of Americans would likely still be alive today, some areas of the economy would probably be much less wobbly and, in all likelihood, we would be preparing for President Trump's second term.

That did not happen and now he and his advisers are soon to be out of a job. But the excitement about the vaccines might show them a way to re-enter, at least a little, into the public's good graces. The next step is quite simple: embrace science and, more importantly, convince Trump's core voters that Covid-19 is a real, not fake, crisis with (hopefully soon) a real, not fake, vaccine that can help prevent a real, not fake, death.
In other words, to legitimately claim some credit for the vaccine excitement ahead, the President and his team must not only praise the ingenious messenger RNA platform, but also embrace science itself and with it, the entire world of cold hard facts.
